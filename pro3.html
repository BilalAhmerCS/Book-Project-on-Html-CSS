My Favourite Book(The Holy Quran) by Bilal Ahmer</marquee> 

</center>

<font size="8">
<h1><u>Introduction:</u></h1>
The <b>Holy Quran</b> is my favourite book. It provides us language and messages of God. For more than thirteen centuries, it has guided humanity. It was revealed to Hazrat Muhammad (may peace be upon him), the last Prophet, in the 7th century, valid till the world exists.</p>

<h1><u>About Holy Quran:</u></h1>
The <b>Holy Quran</b> is written in the purest and most perfect form of Arabic. It has about 77,640 words and is divided into chapters and verses. The chapters are called suras, which are 114 in all. The opening chapter of the Holy Quran is very short, having six lines. We Muslims repeat it several times a day, and it is called the Fatiha, that is, the preface or introduction. It at once affects the feelings of a true Muslim. He cannot do anything evil or bad if he understands its meaning.</p>

The <b>Holy Quran</b> makes it clear that Hazrat Muhammad (may peace be upon him) was bringing Islam back to its first, original purity, the only true religion, which had existed since the beginning of the universe. Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) is the last in the line of prophets, going back in time to Adam. Therefore, the Holy Quran is the last of all the holy books revealed by Allah to his prophets. Whereas the other books changed or got corrupted with time, the Quran still exists in its first original (pristine) purity. Every word of it is Gods word, perfect and pure. I rightly like this book most of all.</p>

<h1><u>Conclusion:</u></h1>
Islam means obedience to the will of Allah. The will of Allah is expressed in the Quran, clearly and completely. It contains the Islamic law in its basis. The Islamic law covers our private life regarding our foods, dress, marriage, prayers, etc. It also tells us clearly about our public life regarding the duties of the government and our duties towards society. It explains, for example, the rules regarding zakat. It explains how we can establish a society in which all help each other and none troubles anyone-a society based on the principles of honesty, justice, and fair play.</p>

<font size="6">
If we want to live perfectly on the earth and make our future (other-worldly) life bright, we should follow the Holy Quran as well as we can. We should try to live nobly and honestly as the Quran tells us</p>
